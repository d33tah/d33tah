### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I like writing HTML scrapers, tinkering with [information security](https://github.com/d33tah/aflize), [data science](https://github.com/d33tah/plgov), [low-level](https://github.com/d33tah/a-look-at-ext4/blob/master/main.ipynb) and embedded programming, as well as experimenting with various DevOps platforms. Sometimes I write tools for myself that also turn out to be useful for others, such as my projects for learning Chinese. I also started a local [hackerspace](https://lodz.hackerspace.pl/) and some projects are wrote are also published [there](https://github.com/hakierspejs).
